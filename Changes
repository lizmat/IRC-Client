Revision history for IRC::Client

{{$NEXT}}

4.0.7  2022-01-07T00:01:03+01:00
    - Make sure that an exception in react/whenever quits

4.0.6  2021-12-15T15:24:11+01:00
    - Make PING check more reliable by scheduling one every time
      the client says something on the server (apparently IRC servers
      treat anything the client says as a PONG, so the timeout timer
      server side appears to be reset then)
    - Remove the "use IRC::Client::Message" endpoint again, it was the
      wrong fix.  Code that is trying to use the separate module, should
      just remove that and just do a "use IRC::Client" instead

    - Fix PING test logic: it didn't work
